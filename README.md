# Maze-Solver-BFS
Visualization of BFS while solving a custom-made maze using Python.

BFS or Breadth-First search is a graph traversal algorithm that starts traversing the graph from the root node and explores all the neighboring nodes. Then, it selects the nearest node and explores all the unexplored nodes.
BFS is complete and optimal i.e it can be used to find the optimal path between two nodes of any graph.

Requirements:
- python=3.7 or higher
- pygame=2.0.1
